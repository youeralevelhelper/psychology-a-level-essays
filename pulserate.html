<p>Peter is studying psychology at university and has decided to conduct an experiment about positive emotions and pulse rate because he believes that people's pulse rate changes with mood.
  </p>
<p>
   Describe how Peter could conduct a laboratory experiment to test whether pulse rate differs when people experience positive and negative emotions. Do not refer to sample/sampling techniques and ethical guidelines/issues in your answer.

    <h3>Aim</h3>
    <p>
      To investigate whether pulse rate differs when people experience positive and negative emotions. </p>
  </section>
 

  <section class="design-block">
    <h3>Research method</h3>
    <p> The study will be conducted as a laboratory experiment in National Research Centre. </p>
  </section>


  <section class="design-block">
    <h3>Variables</h3>
    <p><strong>IV:</strong> Emotion of people (positive or negative)</p>
    <p><strong>DV:</strong> Pulse rate (mean heart beats per minute)</p>
  </section>

  <section class="design-block">
    <h3>Operationalisation of variables</h3>
    <p>
     IV is manipulated by letting participants watch different types of movies, those who watched comedy will be assumed to have positive emotions, those watching melodrama will be assumed to have negative emotions
    </p>   
    <p>
      DV is measured by using a fitness app on a digital watch that would be worn throughout by the participants the movie 
    </p>
  
  </section>

<section class="design-block">
    <h3>Experimental Design</h3>
    <p> The experimental design used will be independent measure design.
Half of the participants will watch comedy movie and the other half will watch melodrama.
</p>
  </section>


  <section class="design-block">
    <h3>Controls and Standardisations</h3>
    <p>
     Both movies should be around 120 minutes long. All participants will be seated in a dark quiet room alone. They should eat normally prior arriving to the lab but refrain from consuming caffeine or alcohol. All participants should be non-smokers as nicotine will affect heart rate. They should also have no illness or medical condition.
    </p>
    </section>

  <section class="design-block">
    <h3>Procedures</h3>
    <p>
     Participants are allocated randomly to watch either movie. Participants will arrive at the laboratory 15 minutes before the designated time. They will all be given a digital watch and guidance will be provided to teach them how to activate the fitness app to monitor their pulse rate once the movie starts. The app should be switched on during the entire movie period. Two groups of participants will be seated in two different rooms. When the movie is played, there will be a voice recording reminding the participants to start the fitness app. At the end of the two hours, participants leave the room and return the digital watch to the researcher.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="design-block">
    <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
    <p>
     Quantitative data is collected. The average pulse rate will be calculated for each participant, and the mean bpm for each group will be determined. A bar chart will be plotted to represent the data for comparison (X-axis: happy/ sad emotions, Y-axis: mean pulse rate (bpm))
