  <li><strong>P</strong> – The study used triangulation for data collection</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – By incorporating several different method, researchers can have more detailed in-depth
investigation and data collection</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – For example, researchers uses interview and self-report (distress rating and severity rating) to

  <li><strong>E</strong> – In behavioural exposure therapy, participants might suffer from distress having to face their own phobia</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – For example, the boy had to complete in vivo exposure task by touching and feeling the buttons from the lowest hierarchy to the highest. His distress rating increased after 3 sessions of behavioural exposure even though he could handle more buttons</li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – The exposure technique caused distress and might worsen phobia</li>
