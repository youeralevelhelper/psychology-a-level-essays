<h3>Strengths </h3>
<ul class="peel">
  <li><strong>P</strong> – The study used structured observation</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – Observers only had to focus on limited range of behaviours</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – For example, use of behavioural checklist to measure the success of trunk here, trunk up, steady, bucket and blow</li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – Results are more reliable due to standardisation in behaviours being observed</li>
</ul>

<ul class="peel">
  <li><strong>P</strong> – The study followed the ethical guidelines for animals</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – Housing conditions catered to the needs of animals</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – Although elephants were chained, the setup allowed enough laxity in the chains for elephants to walk around, they were also provided with sufficient food consisting of fresh grasses and dhana.</li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – Animals does not suffer from distress or deprivation </li>
</ul>

<ul class="peel">
  <li><strong>P</strong> – The study collected quantitative data</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – Quantitative data allowed for easier statistical analysis and comparison</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – For example, success rate of trunk wash improved from 39.0% after 10 sessions to 89.3% after 35 sessions</li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – Researches can draw more valid conclusions due to lower chances of misinterpretation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Weaknesses </h3>
<ul class="peel">
  <li><strong>P</strong> – The study consisted of a gender bias sample</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – Findings cannot be generalised to elephants of both sexes</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – For example, all 4 juvenile and 1 adult elephants are females </li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – Findings are not representative of all elephants because different sex have different dynamics</li>
</ul>

<ul class="peel">
  <li><strong>P</strong> – There might be potential distress to animals</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – Trunk wash is not something that the elephants were used to</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – For example, the initial introduction of syringe for the injection of saline water was required for the trunk wash
process</li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – It was seen as an aversive stimulus for elephants</li>
</ul>

<ul class="peel">
  <li><strong>P</strong> – The study is relatively subjective </li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – Success of trunk wash process was based on trainer’s subjective judgement whether behaviours are sufficient to pass the trunk wash</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> –Elephants’ performance were evaluated from the 10th session, with success defined as performing the correct behaviour in response to 80% of cues by the trainer</li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – Potential researcher bias will reduce internal validity of findings as results might be influenced by trainer’s perception and feelings</li>
</ul>
