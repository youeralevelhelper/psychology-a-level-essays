<h3>Strengths </h3>
<ul class="peel">
  <li><strong>P</strong> – The research method used is a field experiment</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – Participants were in their natural environment</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – The study is conducted in New York subway station involving passengers riding on the train from
Harlem to Bronx station</li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – Findings have high ecological validity as it reflects natural behaviour</li>
</ul>

<ul class="peel">
  <li><strong>P</strong> – The study collected qualitative data</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – Qualitative data is more in depth and allows researchers to explore rationale for a behaviour. It also complements quantitative data</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – For example, it was observed that the participants showed signs of extreme stress such as sweating, trembling and seizures</li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – Researchers further understood that subjects’s behaviour were due to conflict between to not
harm others or to obey authority </li>
</ul>

<ul class="peel">
  <li><strong>P</strong> – Participants had lower possibilities of showing demand characteristics</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – Due to being unaware of the nature of study, there is minimised bias as participants will not alter their behaviour to match the aim of the
study</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – For example, participants were unaware that the victims were stooge played by students from General Studies
at Columbia University</li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – Genuine response from the participants are reflective of natural reactions, increasing validity of findings</li>
</ul>

<h3>Weaknesses </h3>
<ul class="peel">
  <li><strong>P</strong> – Deception was involved</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – Participants cannot give full informed consent as they were unaware of the actual aim</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – They were just normal passengers taking the subway train while being misled about the nature of incident </li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – Participants might suffer from psychological harm such as guilt and distress by not helping given that they believed the victims really fainted</li>
</ul>

<ul class="peel">
  <li><strong>P</strong> – Situational variables are difficult to be controlled</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – It is difficult to ensure it is only the IV (type and race of victims) affecting the DV (helping
behaviour) as situational variables can confound the results</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – For example, weather and train delay might influence participants’ helping behaviour</li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – Findings have lower internal validity</li>
</ul>

<ul class="peel">
  <li><strong>P</strong> – Participants were not debriefed after being deceived</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – This is due to the large sample size involved</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – For example, about 4450 participants were involved in the sample</li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – Participants cannot be debriefed to return to their original psychological state</li>
</ul>
