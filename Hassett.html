<h3>Strengths </h3>
<ul class="peel">
  <li><strong>P</strong> – The study is a field experiment</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – An experiment has high level of controls to increase validity of findings</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – For example, for each trial, plush toys and wheeled toys were always placed 10 metres apart at the outdoor compound</li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – Controls can reduce effect of extraneous variable, ensuring that it is only the IV (sex of rhesus monkeys) affecting the DV (play behaviour)</li>
</ul>

<ul class="peel">
  <li><strong>P</strong> – The study collected quantitative data</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – Quantitative data allow easier statistical analysis and comparison</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – For example, the study shows that 73 percent of male monkeys show preference towards wheeled toys compared to only 9 percent of them showing preference towards plush toys</li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – Researchers can draw more valid conclusions as quantitative data has lower chances of misinterpretation </li>
</ul>

<ul class="peel">
  <li><strong>P</strong> – The study followed the ethical guidelines for animals</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – Needs of animal are taken care of</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – For example, the monkeys were housed in their natal group with a 25x25 metre outdoor compound and temperature-controlled indoor space</li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – This ensures that there is no crowding that will cause distress, the monkeys were protected from psychological harm</li>
</ul>

<h3>Weaknesses </h3>
<ul class="peel">
  <li><strong>P</strong> – The study lacks mundane realism</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – Findings cannot be applied to a range of real-world situation</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – For example, play behaviour with plush and wheeled toys were not a usual task for monkeys </li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – Findings have low ecological validity</li>
</ul>

<ul class="peel">
  <li><strong>P</strong> – The use of captive monkeys</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – Captive animals were removed from their original habitat, which might suppress their natural instincts</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – For example, monkeys used in the study were all from Yerkes National Primates Research Centre Field Station</li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – It is unethical as captivity is against the nature of animals</li>
</ul>

<ul class="peel">
  <li><strong>P</strong> – Findings of the study has low generalisability</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – Data collected cannot be applied to wild monkeys due to possibility of different dynamics between monkey troops</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – For example, the sample of the study consist of 23 female and 11 male rhesus monkeys, all living within the same monkey troop</li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – Different troops may have different play behaviours in real-life settings</li>
</ul>
