    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <p>
     The therapy will start with psycho-education of the ABCDE model.

  <section class="design-block">
    <h3>Data analysis</h3>
    <p>
      Quantitative data is collected. The higher the score out of 75, the more severe the symptoms.A graph will be plotted to examine the differences between their scores before, 1 month into, 3 months into and 6 months into the REBT therapy. </p>
<p> ANOVA test is carried out to look for differences between scores of different intervals to see whether is it significant or due to chance. If the value is greater than critical value of p=0.05, this shows that results are significant.Post-hoc test could be done to see whether there is a significant decrease in symptoms of unipolar depression between baseline score before REBT and 6 months into REBT.
