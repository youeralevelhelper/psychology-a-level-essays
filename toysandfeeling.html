     Children are brought into an empty classroom and seated in front of a table. Each child will complete the questionnaire by themselves in the classroom alone to respect their personal space and emotional territory. Before they are being left alone, the researched will explain to them what they need to do and ask them to indicate how old they are. There is a one hour time limit for children to complete the questionnaire. The children will be instructed to leave the room once completing it and a researcher waiting outside the room will collect the paper and escort them back to their classes.

Total score of each individual children will be tallied and a mean score for the two category will be calculated. The data will be represented in a bar chart (x-axis: age group, y-axis: mean score). Error bars can be plotted to analyse the significance of the difference between young and old children.
