<h3>Strengths </h3>
<ul class="peel">
  <li><strong>P</strong> – The study has high confidentiality</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – Personal data of participants were not disclosed to the public</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – For example, real names of participants were replaced with initials such as WD, KC</li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – The study followed the ethical guidelines</li>
</ul>

<ul class="peel">
  <li><strong>P</strong> – The study collected quantitative data</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – Quantitative data has lower chances of misinterpretation</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – For example, the study found that 88% of 5-minutes REM dream period estimation were correct compared to 78% correct estimation for 15-minutes period</li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – Findings were easier to be analysed and compared so researches can draw more valid conclusions</li>
</ul>

<ul class="peel">
  <li><strong>P</strong> – The study is highly objective</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – This is due to the use of scientific tools</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – For example, the use of EEG to detect brain waves and EOG to detect potential of contraction and relaxation of muscle around the eyes</li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – This reduces researcher bias because data is directly measurable and observable, and no additional interpretation needed</li>
</ul>

<h3>Weaknesses </h3>
<ul class="peel">
  <li><strong>P</strong> – The study consists of a relatively small sample size</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – Small sample will have lower generalizability due to variability of participants is limited as they might all have similar characteristics</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – For example, the study only consisting of 9 participants, with only 5 being studied in detailed</li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – Findings are not representative of the target population</li>
</ul>

<ul class="peel">
  <li><strong>P</strong> – The study lacks mundane realism</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – The study being conducted in a sleep lab rather than the participants’ natural sleeping environment might not truly reflect humans real sleeping patterns</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – For example, in real life participants do not sleep with EEG and EOG attached to their scalp and around the eyes</li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – Findings have lower ecological validity</li>
</ul>

<ul class="peel">
  <li><strong>P</strong> – Participants might suffer from psychological harm</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – This is due to being awoken several times during sleep</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – For example, all participants were woken up at random times during the night by a loud doorbell sound to report their dreams into a voice recorder</li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – Participants might feel stress as they are unable to perform well during the day due to lack of sleep</li>
</ul>
