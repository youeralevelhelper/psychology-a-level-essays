<h3>Strengths </h3>
<ul class="peel">
  <li><strong>P</strong> – The study has high level of standardisation</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – This is due to the use of controlled observation as a research method</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – For example, all prods given by experimenter were the same and in order for all participants when they refuse to continue.</li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – The study have high reliability and can be replicated easily</li>
</ul>

<ul class="peel">
  <li><strong>P</strong> – The study collected qualitative data</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – Qualitative data is more in depth and allows researchers to explore rationale for a behaviour. It also complements quantitative data</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – For example, it was observed that the participants showed signs of extreme stress such as sweating, trembling and seizures</li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – Researchers further understood that subjects’s behaviour were due to conflict between to not
harm others or to obey authority </li>
</ul>

<ul class="peel">
  <li><strong>P</strong> – The study collected quantitative data</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – Quantitative data allowed for easier statistical analysis and comparison</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – For example, all 40 subjects gave shocks to 300V while 26/40 subjects obeyed the orders & administered shocks to the highest level available, 450V</li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – Researches can draw more valid conclusions due to lower chances of misinterpretation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Weaknesses </h3>
<ul class="peel">
  <li><strong>P</strong> – Deception was involved</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – Participants cannot give full informed consent as they were unaware of the actual aim</li>

</ul>

<ul class="peel">

  <li><strong>E</strong> – Findings cannot be applied to both genders as there is different dynamics between genders</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – Sample consist of 40 males from New Haven and surrounding communities, no females were involved</li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – Findings have low generalisability to the target population of both genders</li>
</ul>

<ul class="peel">
  <li><strong>P</strong> – Participants were not protected from harm</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – Participants suffered from psychological harm as they felt distress to face two conflicting emotions on whether to obey or to not harm others</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – For example, observers in the study noted signs of extreme tension such as trembling, sweating and seizures</li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – Participants might suffer from change in their psychological aspect such as suffering from trauma</li>
