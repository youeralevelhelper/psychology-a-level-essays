<h3>Strengths </h3>
<ul class="peel">
  <li><strong>P</strong> – The study was a lab experiment</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – Experiment has high level of controls to increase the validity of findings</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – For example, the presentation method of lineups were controlled in which videos and photo arrays were shown displayed via 13-inch laptop screen with PowerPoint program</li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – Control reduces the effect of extraneous variable, ensuring that the causal relationship established is more valid</li>
</ul>

<ul class="peel">
  <li><strong>P</strong> – Participants in the study had given informed consent</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – All participants participated in their own will and is aware of the aim of the study and what they will be going through</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – For example, parents of children completed the consent form along with demographic sheet on behalf of the children and adults signed a consent form</li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – The study complied to ethical guidelines </li>
</ul>

<ul class="peel">
  <li><strong>P</strong> – The study collected quantitative data</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – Quantitative data allowed for easier statistical analysis and comparison</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – For example, the study found that children had a 99% correct identification rate for cartoon faces but only had a 23% correct identification rate for human faces</li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – Researches can draw more valid conclusions due to lower chances of misinterpretation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Weaknesses </h3>
<ul class="peel">
  <li><strong>P</strong> – The study lacked mundane realism</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – Findings cannot be applied to a range of real life situations as the task performed by participants is not a usual task</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – For example, all participants have to watch a six-second clip of an unknown human face then identify the person in a line-up </li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – Findings have low ecological validity</li>
</ul>

<ul class="peel">
  <li><strong>P</strong> – Repeated measure was used in the study</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – All participants go through all four levels of IV and this increases the possibility of order effect</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – The IV consist of two types of line-up (target-present versus target-absent) and two nature of target faces (cartoon versus human)</li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – Findings have lower internal validity as participants’ performance may decline over time as they feel fatigue for constantly repeating the identification process for four times</li>
</ul>

<ul class="peel">
  <li><strong>P</strong> – The study used opportunity sampling to recruit participants </li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – Participants might be all of the same type, reducing the generalisability of findings</li>
  <li><strong>E</strong> – For example, all children were recruited from from kindergarten classes in 3 private schools in Eastern Ontario while all adults were recruited from introductory psychology participant pool at Eastern Ontario University</li>
  <li><strong>L</strong> – The findings are less representative of the target population</li>
</ul>
