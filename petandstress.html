    Sarah believes that pet(s) can help in reducing stress. She hypothesizes that the more pets a person has, the less likely they experience stress.
  </p>
<p>
   Describe how Sarah could conduct a correlational study to investigate the relationship between having pet(s) and stress. Do not refer to sample/sampling techniques and ethical guidelines/issues in your answer.

    <h3>Aim</h3>
    <p>
      To investigate the relationship between having pets and stress.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section class="design-block">
    <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
    <p>
      It is hypothesized that there is a negative correlation between having pets and stress. This is a one-tailed directional hypothesis.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="design-block">
    <h3>Research method</h3>
    <p> This study will be conducted as a correlation study with two co-variables. Self-reports that is questionnaires will be used to collect data.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="design-block">
    <h3>Co-variables</h3>
    <p><strong>Variable 1:</strong> Number of pets</p>
    <p><strong>Variable 2:</strong> Level of stress</p>
  </section>

  <section class="design-block">
    <h3>Operationalisation of variables</h3>
    <p>
      Questionnaire form will contain 25 closed questions on stress level with a 5-point rating scale (1 being 'rarely or never true' and 5 being 'often or always true').
    </p>   
    <p>
      Example questions: 'I feel overwhelmed by day to day tasks', 'I do not feel motivated at most times'
    </p>
  <p>
      Filler questions: 'I feed my pets regularly'
    </p>
 <p>
      One demographic information question at the end of the questionnaire will ask participants to indicate how many pets reared more than one year do they have.
    </p>
  </section>


  <section class="design-block">
    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <p>
     Participants who consent to join will be brought into an empty room with a table and a chair. They will be given the questionnaire in paper and pencil method to be completed individually without any presence of others. They will only be given a maximum of 30 minutes to complete it.
    </p>
    </section>

  <section class="design-block">
    <h3>Data analysis</h3>
    <p>
      Quantitative data is collected. The total stress level score of each participant will be calculated. The data collected will be plotted as a scatter plot with x-axis as number of pets, y-axis as stress level score. A best fit line will be drawn to see whether the hypothesis is supported. A line going downward will indicate a negative correlation between the two variables. The correlation coefficient will be calculated to determine the strength of correlation, the closer it is to 1.00 the stronger the correlation.
