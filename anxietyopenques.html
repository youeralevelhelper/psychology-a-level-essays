  <section class="design-block">
    <h3>Question Interpretation</h3>
    <p>
   Two researchers will interpret the responses collected. The data will be coded based on categories and converted from qualitative data to quantitative data for better analysis and comparison. Researchers will look for words such as 'heart beat increases', 'sweating' and 'nausea' to rate the participants' physical symptoms. If the frequency of such words is high, the researched will rank the students for 5 from a scale of 0-5 with 0 being normal and 5 being severe.
    </p>
 <p>
   They will also look for words such as 'worried', 'uneasy' and 'something bad will happen' to rate for participants' cognitive symptoms with the same scale.  </p>
  </section>

  <section class="design-block">
    <h3>Data analysis</h3>
    <p>
      Quantitative data is collected. The two researchers will rate independently and compare the scores between each other. If the scores correlate, the questionnaire has high inter-rater reliability. Filler questions will be excluded for analysis. Out of maximum score of 100, the higher the score the more likely the subject has GAD. The data will be plotted into a bar chart to compare between different subjects of different university years.
